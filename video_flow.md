# General video analysis workflow

Starting at the point of having video recorded on a camera, my workflow tends to look something like this (though it depends a bit on what my research goal is):

- Use [MPEG Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com) to capture and compress the video from the camera
- If the video is of an interview, transcribe it using [Transcriva](http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/transcriva/) (a similar program for Windows users is [Inqscribe](https://www.inqscribe.com))
  - Export the transcript as an RTF file
  - Import the video (and transcript if its an interview) into [Transana](https://www.transana.com).
- If the video is of observational in nature, create a content log (as a kind of fake transcript) with time coding in Transana. This or a detailed transcript allows clips to be identified and categorized
- Usually at this point, I create keywords for structural characteristics such as which participant is speaking and the materials involved. I then go through the video and identify where these characteristics exist. This gives me a way to break down the video and if I have a lot of videos, it allows me to search across them for similar instances.
- Using the clips and keywords functions in Transana, I identify and organize instances across the video data I have. I tend to work in an inductive recursive way and as I create new categories and keywords, I go back through the instances I have already identified.
- Once I have identified specific short sections of a video or videos that I want to perform more detailed analysis on, I the move to [ELAN](https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/)
- In ELAN, I usually create multiple channels and input as much timecoded detail of the interactions in a clip as possible. The might include:
  - A channel for the discourse of each speaker
  - A channel for gestures
  - A channel for physical interactions with the technolog involved
  - A channel for the communicative actions made by the technology
