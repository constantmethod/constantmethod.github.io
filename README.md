As people interact online, the traces they leave drive the digital platforms for social interaction they use. For educational researchers, traces like written documents in classrooms have always been of interest, but unlike these traces, digital traces produced on social platforms like web forums and social media are not secondary sources for the researcher trying to understand learning in interaction. Instead, these traces are the primary interactional means and the means that users, technical platforms and researchers have for making sense of any activity that takes place. However, as social interaction online has expanded and become integral to many facets of life, the availability of trace data has exploded leaving researchers with an interest in understanding interaction on social platforms with massive datasets to handle.   New approaches available to researchers include scraping web-forums and collecting data through social media APIs, finding patterns and identifying critical instances through computational content and social network analyses, following topics and participants over time, visualization and trace-interviewing, and ethical concerns of working with trace data.

This site contains tutorials relevant for applying trace ethnography methods to questions of learning in online environments.
