However, much less is known about their effects in discretionary learning settings, especially in computing education and educational games. We hypothesized that adding assessments to an educational computing game would provide extra opportunities for players to practice and correct misconceptions, thereby affecting their performance on subsequent levels and their motivation to continue playing. To test this, we designed a game called Gidget, in which players help a robot find and fix defects in programs that follow a mastery learning paradigm. Across two studies, we manipulated the inclusion of multiple choice and self-explanation assessment levels in the game, measuring their impact on engagement and level completion speed. In our first study, we found that including assessments caused learners to voluntarily play longer and complete more levels, suggesting increased engagement; in our second study, we found that including assessments caused learners to complete levels faster, suggesting increased understanding. These findings suggest that including assessments in a discretionary computing education game may be a key design strategy for improving informal learning of computing concepts.

Supporting participants' group awareness about the visibility of the arguments they construct and about prospective future debate with peers in order to promote argument quality may be particularly suited for learning in Social Networking Sites. Additional argumentation scripts may directly foster argumentative knowledge construction. In a 2 × 2 study (N = 81), we isolated and investigated the effects of group awareness support and argumentation scripts during individual preparation in a Facebook app on domain and argumentative knowledge. Our results reveal that group awareness support of upcoming argumentative processes can be counterproductive for learning in Social Networking Sites.

Users develop projects, which are graphical interfaces consisting of interacting programming blocks. We investigated two fundamental questions of how we can model informal learning, and which patterns of informal learning emerge. We proceeded in two phases. First, we modeled learning as a trajectory of cumulative programming block usage by long-term users who created at least 50 projects. Second, we applied K-means++ clustering to uncover patterns of learning and corresponding subpopulations. We found four groups of users manifesting four different patterns of learning, ranging from the smallest to the largest improvement. At one end of the spectrum, users learned more and in a faster manner. At the opposite end, users did not show much learning progress, even after creating dozens of projects. The modeling and clustering of trajectory patterns that enabled us to quantitatively analyze informal learning may be applicable to other similar communities. The results can also support administrators of online communities in implementing customized interventions for specific subpopulations.

In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use ""and,"" ""or,"" and ""not"" statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners' programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation. © 2017 ACM.","Collaborative learning; Computer science education; Computer supported collaborative learning; Educational data mining; Equity; Learning analytics; Social networking forums; Social networking sites","Data mining; E-learning; Education computing; Online systems; Social networking (online); Websites; Collaborative learning; Computer Science Education; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Educational data mining; Equity; Learning analytics; Social networking sites; Education",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028586628

As membership of the Scratch online community grew over time, interest-based subcultures started to emerge.

The implementation of digital services requires problem solving, design skills, logical thinking, an understanding of how computers and networks operate, and programming competence. These abilities can be considered as coding skills. The aim of the study is to find and classify the different approaches and methods of promoting and learning coding skills. In addition, coding initiatives in Finland are analyzed both from both an historical and a present-day point of view. As a result, we identified three different approaches to learning coding skills: 1) in formal settings (schools within the curriculum); 2) in non-formal settings (online, after school clubs); 3) in informal events (hackathons, jams etc.). In many cases, schools are utilizing coding events and materials created by non-profit organizations, governments, or companies. Coding is also learned in after school clubs on robotics or by creating devices using cheap computing hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Coding; Computational thinking; Computer programming; Education; Maker culture",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018783646

It is hard for learners to be aware of the knowledge incompleteness. The main issue addressed in this paper is how to enhance their awareness. Our approach to this issue is to enable learners to publish knowledge obtained from their learning process to review it. The most important point towards knowledge publishing is how to represent knowledge so that the learners can reflect on it from another perspective. However, such knowledge representation would be troublesome for the learners. This paper discusses how to promote learners' knowledge publishing by automatically generating a hypertext with TOC (Table Of Contents) as representation of knowledge they have learned in their learning process. Publishing the hypertext enables the learners to gain not only their own reviews but also the reviews from the peers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Computer science; HTML; Learning systems; Knowledge publishing; Self-directed learning; Table Of Contents; Knowledge representation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750706609

Prior work has delved into the problem of underrepresentation in STEM and specifically in Computing Education to uncover the barriers impacting these groups. Yet, attraction and retention remains a challenge. I argue that while formal learning pathways are critical to increasing participation of diverse learners, it is also integral to provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities as well. My research uses mixed-methods within a design-based research approach to offer and evaluate an active learning beginners’ programming workshop called Code For Her. The workshop is designed to introduce females and gender-diverse individuals to web development. My goal is to analyze participants’ experiences and progress within a trajectory framework, producing a narrative of their behaviors and attitudes over both short-term and longer-term intervals. In a pilot study of the workshop design, I observed increases in self-efficacy and positive attitudes, as well as changes in ways of thinking about computing. I note that the brief exposure of a workshop may seed understanding and skills in computation, but is not likely to convert non-programmers into programmers. Instead, I am exploring a new construct - computational grounding - that refers to participants’ enhanced orientation toward computing-related behaviors. I will operationalize and study this construct using the workshop activities, thereby enhancing discussions of computational thinking. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Coding workshop; Gender; Informal learning; Non-programmers","Computer programming; Coding workshop; Computational skills; Computational thinkings; Design-based research; Gender; Informal learning; Non-formal learning; Non-programmers; Computer science",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071290823

However, they are often male-oriented and create barriers for women to participate and earn reputations. We develop an understanding of how male and female developers participate in the online Q&A communities and how their participation impacts their successfulness regarding reputations. Using the data from the Stack Overflow, we quantitatively examine the differences in behavior and outcomes between men and women.

However, research has found that these learners might not gain equal benefit from such resources, in particular because culture may affect how people learn from and use online resources. We therefore expect to see cultural differences in how people use and benefit from visual debuggers. We investigated the use of one popular online debugger which allows users to execute Python code and navigate bidirectionally through the execution using forward-steps and back-steps. We examined behavioral logs of 78,369 users from 69 countries and conducted an experiment with 522 participants from 82 countries. We found that people from countries that tend to prefer self-directed learning (such as those from countries with a low Power Distance, which tend to be less hierarchical than others) used about twice as many back-steps. We also found that for individuals whose values aligned with instructor-directed learning (those who scored high on a 'Conservation' scale), back-steps were associated with less debugging success. © 2018 IEEE.","Non-linear learning; Program visualization. cross-cultural studies","Computer programming; Computer science; Cross-cultural study; Cultural difference; How people learn; Low Power; Nonlinear learning; Online resources; Python code; Self-directed learning; Visual languages",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056848525

Many women utilize various online communities to gain access to technical fields. Among many such online communities, online programming Q&A communities are particularly important by serving as knowledge bases for self-directed informal learning and providing opportunities for individuals to exhibit their credible, verifiable expertise for career opportunities and advancements. However, these Q&A communities are often male-oriented, hence may create barriers for women to participate and earn reputations. In this paper, we aim to develop an understanding towards how male and female developers participate in the online Q&A communities and how their participation impacts their successfulness in terms of reputations. Using the data from the Stack Overflow, we quantitative examine the differences in behavior and outcomes between men and women. Our analyses reveal significant differences in how men and women participate in the online Q&A community and how successful they are. For example, women have much lower reputations on average which are mostly resulting from women and men's differences in their activities.

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal. That way, the symposium will significantly expand previous methods for the assessment of self-, co-and shared regulation during collaborative learning. © ISLS.",,"Surveys; Co-regulation; Coding scheme; Collaborative learning; Educational context; Group learning; Group process; Regulation process; Self regulation; E-learning",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053911300

They recognised the growing importance of using the Internet, through computers, tablets, and mobile phones, and a variety of formal, non-formal and informal e-learning technologies as alternatives to more traditional leisure and cultural activities. Their awareness of their competence in using technology for learning scopes was linked to their cultural interests. They showed little or no interest in interacting with other participants or tutors and were critical about completing multiple-choice quizzes.

Instruction concepts to support learners' autonomy and selfdirection are no novelty; their relevance has been discussed with changing perspectives for a long time. However, the discussion gained new relevance through the EU's economical and political motivated efforts for life-long learning as well as through studies, announcing changing learning contexts, e.g. through social networking, lately. Besides these new efforts, older ones exist, e.g. the paradigm change in education, from instructional to experience based learning, which are also decisive for the idea of Networked Learning. The paradigm shift already led to a changed perception about learning and instruction styles. However, the actual instruction concepts still refer to an ""instructor"" respectively coach, who can no longer be seen as always given in today's world. Networked Learning offers hence an opportunity to learn self-directed, without an instructor, tutor or coach, at any time and place. Instead, learners can draw on a worldwide resource-pool of knowledge and ""peers"" through networks. Networks can thus be seen as learning attendants through whom (external) stimuli, reflection and validation is given. © 2010 IADIS.","Collaborative learning; Instruction concepts; Networks; Self-directed learning","Collaborative learning; Experience-based learning; Instruction concepts; Learning context; Life long learning; Networked learning; Networks; Paradigm shifts; Self-directed learning; Social networking; Social values; Worldwide resources; Computer science; E-learning; Information systems; Lakes; Learning systems; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955137753
