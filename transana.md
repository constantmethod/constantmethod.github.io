# Using Transana to work with large collections of videos


[Transana](https://www.transana.com) is an application developed by David Woods which can run on either Mac OS X or Windows and allows users to perform qualitative analysis of video data. In many ways it is similar to other QDA software like Atlas.ti or Nvivo but with much better features for handling video data such as interviews and observations.

The really useful basic feature of Transana is that videos are synchronized with their transcripts so that when an instance is coded in either the video or the transcript it is automatically connected to the other.
